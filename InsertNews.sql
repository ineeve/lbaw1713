Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','0.png',32,8,56);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','10.png',89,13,94);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease.

One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','25.png',-32,2,13);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','35.png',52,9,69);

For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','40.png',81,12,88);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly.

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','50.png',26,7,52);

When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation.

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving.

To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity.

The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path.

To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','75.png',0,5,34);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','80.png',92,13,95);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology?

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','90.png',-2,5,33);

To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','95.png',29,7,54);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','105.png',89,13,94);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','115.png',94,13,97);

The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','120.png',15,6,44);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','130.png',-8,4,29);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','135.png',-47,1,3);

On the left, the enhanced surface image has been colorized using data from methane filters in a way that mimics the natural color of Titan.</div></div><p>There was a full session devoted to Cassini on Monday (<a href=''https://www.sciencenews.org/article/5-things-about-saturn-cassini-mission''>Lisa Grossman wrote up a nice summary here</a>), but then on Tuesday, another morning session focused entirely on Titan, called &ldquo;<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/sess203.pdf''>Titan Is Terrific</a>&rdquo;. (That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','145.png',-24,3,18);

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','160.png',-7,4,29);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','170.png',31,8,55);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','175.png',-40,1,7);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology?

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','185.png',60,10,74);

Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','190.png',-11,4,27);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','200.png',80,12,87);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','210.png',29,7,54);

We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','215.png',-16,3,23);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

Congress thoroughly rejected every major cut proposed to NASA and other science agencies by the Trump Administration, often providing them with funding increases instead. This is arguably the best budget for national science investment in a decade.</p><p>Should this legislation pass, NASA would receive a $1.1 billion increase to $20.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. This is a far better outcome than the White House''s original proposal, which would have cut NASA by 1 percent to $19.1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is NASA''s best budget since 2009, when it received a temporary $1 billion boost from the economic stimulus bill.</p><p>And it wasn''t just NASA. As <a href=''http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/science-gets-major-boost-2018-us-spending-deal''>Science Magazine points</a> out, every federal science program maintained or grew its budget. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, the Department of Energy''s Office of Science&mdash;all will receive budget increases. Basically, Congress grew the size of the pie, so nearly everyone was able to take a bigger slice.</p><p>Several Planetary Society funding priorities were contained in this bill. First and foremost, the robotic Mars Exploration Program receives a $75 million increase with specific directions to ''support the Mars Sample return mission and orbiter'', in line with our recommendations and as a consequence of our <a href=''http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/advocacy/2017/Mars-in-Retrograde---The-Planetary-Society---2017.pdf''><em>Mars in Retrograde </em>report</a> released last year.</p><p>Planetary defense has been another major area of work for our Advocacy team this year, and we were very pleased to see NEOCam&mdash;a proposed space telescope for detecting near-Earth objects&mdash;funded at $35 million. While not ideal, this amount will help maintain critical production lines for sensors needed by this mission.</p><p>And then there''s Europa, the mission The Planetary Society and its members have worked so hard to support over the years. It stands to receive $595 million in 2018, not just for the Clipper spacecraft, but for work on a lander as well. The legislation reiterates that the mission launch in 2022 on a Space Launch System rocket. NASA has stated it wants to launch the Clipper in 2025 on a commercial rocket.</p><p>The Planetary Society and its members worked hard for these goals in addition to larger budgets for NASA and science in general. Congress listened, and key members of the appropriations committees really came through for these important priorities. They also explicitly supported the priorities recommended by the scientific community through the decadal survey process&mdash;another commendable action and important to a stable future of space science and exploration.</p><p>Okay, let''s break things down.</p></div>','223.png',41,8,61);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','225.png',-20,3,21);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','230.png',30,8,54);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','240.png',65,10,77);

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','255.png',89,13,93);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','265.png',26,7,51);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','270.png',-19,3,22);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology?

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','280.png',1,5,35);

Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','285.png',-38,2,9);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','295.png',78,12,86);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','305.png',52,9,69);

We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface.

Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','310.png',3,5,36);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

Congress thoroughly rejected every major cut proposed to NASA and other science agencies by the Trump Administration, often providing them with funding increases instead. This is arguably the best budget for national science investment in a decade.</p><p>Should this legislation pass, NASA would receive a $1.1 billion increase to $20.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. This is a far better outcome than the White House''s original proposal, which would have cut NASA by 1 percent to $19.1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is NASA''s best budget since 2009, when it received a temporary $1 billion boost from the economic stimulus bill.</p><p>And it wasn''t just NASA. As <a href=''http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/science-gets-major-boost-2018-us-spending-deal''>Science Magazine points</a> out, every federal science program maintained or grew its budget. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, the Department of Energy''s Office of Science&mdash;all will receive budget increases. Basically, Congress grew the size of the pie, so nearly everyone was able to take a bigger slice.</p><p>Several Planetary Society funding priorities were contained in this bill. First and foremost, the robotic Mars Exploration Program receives a $75 million increase with specific directions to ''support the Mars Sample return mission and orbiter'', in line with our recommendations and as a consequence of our <a href=''http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/advocacy/2017/Mars-in-Retrograde---The-Planetary-Society---2017.pdf''><em>Mars in Retrograde </em>report</a> released last year.</p><p>Planetary defense has been another major area of work for our Advocacy team this year, and we were very pleased to see NEOCam&mdash;a proposed space telescope for detecting near-Earth objects&mdash;funded at $35 million. While not ideal, this amount will help maintain critical production lines for sensors needed by this mission.</p><p>And then there''s Europa, the mission The Planetary Society and its members have worked so hard to support over the years. It stands to receive $595 million in 2018, not just for the Clipper spacecraft, but for work on a lander as well. The legislation reiterates that the mission launch in 2022 on a Space Launch System rocket. NASA has stated it wants to launch the Clipper in 2025 on a commercial rocket.</p><p>The Planetary Society and its members worked hard for these goals in addition to larger budgets for NASA and science in general. Congress listened, and key members of the appropriations committees really came through for these important priorities. They also explicitly supported the priorities recommended by the scientific community through the decadal survey process&mdash;another commendable action and important to a stable future of space science and exploration.</p><p>Okay, let''s break things down.</p></div>','318.png',-2,5,33);

I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','320.png',57,10,72);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','325.png',-38,2,9);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','335.png',25,7,51);

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','350.png',76,11,85);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','360.png',-33,2,12);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','365.png',89,13,93);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument.

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','375.png',13,6,43);

Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','380.png',-33,2,12);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','390.png',45,9,64);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','400.png',33,8,56);

We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','405.png',-30,2,14);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

Congress thoroughly rejected every major cut proposed to NASA and other science agencies by the Trump Administration, often providing them with funding increases instead. This is arguably the best budget for national science investment in a decade.</p><p>Should this legislation pass, NASA would receive a $1.1 billion increase to $20.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. This is a far better outcome than the White House''s original proposal, which would have cut NASA by 1 percent to $19.1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is NASA''s best budget since 2009, when it received a temporary $1 billion boost from the economic stimulus bill.</p><p>And it wasn''t just NASA. As <a href=''http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/science-gets-major-boost-2018-us-spending-deal''>Science Magazine points</a> out, every federal science program maintained or grew its budget. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, the Department of Energy''s Office of Science&mdash;all will receive budget increases. Basically, Congress grew the size of the pie, so nearly everyone was able to take a bigger slice.</p><p>Several Planetary Society funding priorities were contained in this bill. First and foremost, the robotic Mars Exploration Program receives a $75 million increase with specific directions to ''support the Mars Sample return mission and orbiter'', in line with our recommendations and as a consequence of our <a href=''http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/advocacy/2017/Mars-in-Retrograde---The-Planetary-Society---2017.pdf''><em>Mars in Retrograde </em>report</a> released last year.</p><p>Planetary defense has been another major area of work for our Advocacy team this year, and we were very pleased to see NEOCam&mdash;a proposed space telescope for detecting near-Earth objects&mdash;funded at $35 million. While not ideal, this amount will help maintain critical production lines for sensors needed by this mission.</p><p>And then there''s Europa, the mission The Planetary Society and its members have worked so hard to support over the years. It stands to receive $595 million in 2018, not just for the Clipper spacecraft, but for work on a lander as well. The legislation reiterates that the mission launch in 2022 on a Space Launch System rocket. NASA has stated it wants to launch the Clipper in 2025 on a commercial rocket.</p><p>The Planetary Society and its members worked hard for these goals in addition to larger budgets for NASA and science in general. Congress listened, and key members of the appropriations committees really came through for these important priorities. They also explicitly supported the priorities recommended by the scientific community through the decadal survey process&mdash;another commendable action and important to a stable future of space science and exploration.</p><p>Okay, let''s break things down.</p></div>','413.png',32,8,56);

I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','415.png',7,6,39);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','420.png',33,8,56);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','430.png',39,8,60);

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','445.png',40,8,61);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','455.png',90,13,94);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','460.png',40,8,61);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument.

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','470.png',31,8,55);

Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','475.png',65,11,78);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','485.png',46,9,65);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','495.png',95,13,98);

We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface.

Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','500.png',28,7,53);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

Congress thoroughly rejected every major cut proposed to NASA and other science agencies by the Trump Administration, often providing them with funding increases instead. This is arguably the best budget for national science investment in a decade.</p><p>Should this legislation pass, NASA would receive a $1.1 billion increase to $20.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. This is a far better outcome than the White House''s original proposal, which would have cut NASA by 1 percent to $19.1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is NASA''s best budget since 2009, when it received a temporary $1 billion boost from the economic stimulus bill.</p><p>And it wasn''t just NASA. As <a href=''http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/science-gets-major-boost-2018-us-spending-deal''>Science Magazine points</a> out, every federal science program maintained or grew its budget. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, the Department of Energy''s Office of Science&mdash;all will receive budget increases. Basically, Congress grew the size of the pie, so nearly everyone was able to take a bigger slice.</p><p>Several Planetary Society funding priorities were contained in this bill. First and foremost, the robotic Mars Exploration Program receives a $75 million increase with specific directions to ''support the Mars Sample return mission and orbiter'', in line with our recommendations and as a consequence of our <a href=''http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/advocacy/2017/Mars-in-Retrograde---The-Planetary-Society---2017.pdf''><em>Mars in Retrograde </em>report</a> released last year.</p><p>Planetary defense has been another major area of work for our Advocacy team this year, and we were very pleased to see NEOCam&mdash;a proposed space telescope for detecting near-Earth objects&mdash;funded at $35 million. While not ideal, this amount will help maintain critical production lines for sensors needed by this mission.</p><p>And then there''s Europa, the mission The Planetary Society and its members have worked so hard to support over the years. It stands to receive $595 million in 2018, not just for the Clipper spacecraft, but for work on a lander as well. The legislation reiterates that the mission launch in 2022 on a Space Launch System rocket. NASA has stated it wants to launch the Clipper in 2025 on a commercial rocket.</p><p>The Planetary Society and its members worked hard for these goals in addition to larger budgets for NASA and science in general. Congress listened, and key members of the appropriations committees really came through for these important priorities. They also explicitly supported the priorities recommended by the scientific community through the decadal survey process&mdash;another commendable action and important to a stable future of space science and exploration.</p><p>Okay, let''s break things down.</p></div>','508.png',46,9,65);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','510.png',81,12,88);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','515.png',75,11,84);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','525.png',65,10,77);

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','540.png',-21,3,20);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','550.png',-21,3,20);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','555.png',87,12,92);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology?

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','565.png',-7,4,29);

Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','570.png',8,6,39);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','580.png',42,8,62);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','590.png',42,9,62);

We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface.

Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','595.png',-43,1,5);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

Congress thoroughly rejected every major cut proposed to NASA and other science agencies by the Trump Administration, often providing them with funding increases instead. This is arguably the best budget for national science investment in a decade.</p><p>Should this legislation pass, NASA would receive a $1.1 billion increase to $20.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. This is a far better outcome than the White House''s original proposal, which would have cut NASA by 1 percent to $19.1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is NASA''s best budget since 2009, when it received a temporary $1 billion boost from the economic stimulus bill.</p><p>And it wasn''t just NASA. As <a href=''http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/science-gets-major-boost-2018-us-spending-deal''>Science Magazine points</a> out, every federal science program maintained or grew its budget. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, the Department of Energy''s Office of Science&mdash;all will receive budget increases. Basically, Congress grew the size of the pie, so nearly everyone was able to take a bigger slice.</p><p>Several Planetary Society funding priorities were contained in this bill. First and foremost, the robotic Mars Exploration Program receives a $75 million increase with specific directions to ''support the Mars Sample return mission and orbiter'', in line with our recommendations and as a consequence of our <a href=''http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/advocacy/2017/Mars-in-Retrograde---The-Planetary-Society---2017.pdf''><em>Mars in Retrograde </em>report</a> released last year.</p><p>Planetary defense has been another major area of work for our Advocacy team this year, and we were very pleased to see NEOCam&mdash;a proposed space telescope for detecting near-Earth objects&mdash;funded at $35 million. While not ideal, this amount will help maintain critical production lines for sensors needed by this mission.</p><p>And then there''s Europa, the mission The Planetary Society and its members have worked so hard to support over the years. It stands to receive $595 million in 2018, not just for the Clipper spacecraft, but for work on a lander as well. The legislation reiterates that the mission launch in 2022 on a Space Launch System rocket. NASA has stated it wants to launch the Clipper in 2025 on a commercial rocket.</p><p>The Planetary Society and its members worked hard for these goals in addition to larger budgets for NASA and science in general. Congress listened, and key members of the appropriations committees really came through for these important priorities. They also explicitly supported the priorities recommended by the scientific community through the decadal survey process&mdash;another commendable action and important to a stable future of space science and exploration.</p><p>Okay, let''s break things down.</p></div>','603.png',54,10,70);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','605.png',18,6,46);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','610.png',65,10,77);

On the left, the enhanced surface image has been colorized using data from methane filters in a way that mimics the natural color of Titan.</div></div><p>There was a full session devoted to Cassini on Monday (<a href=''https://www.sciencenews.org/article/5-things-about-saturn-cassini-mission''>Lisa Grossman wrote up a nice summary here</a>), but then on Tuesday, another morning session focused entirely on Titan, called &ldquo;<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/sess203.pdf''>Titan Is Terrific</a>&rdquo;. (That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','620.png',35,8,57);

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','635.png',6,5,38);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','645.png',32,8,56);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','650.png',90,13,94);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument.

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','660.png',53,9,69);

Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','665.png',0,5,34);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','675.png',-23,3,19);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','685.png',-6,4,30);

We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','690.png',-20,3,21);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

Congress thoroughly rejected every major cut proposed to NASA and other science agencies by the Trump Administration, often providing them with funding increases instead. This is arguably the best budget for national science investment in a decade.</p><p>Should this legislation pass, NASA would receive a $1.1 billion increase to $20.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. This is a far better outcome than the White House''s original proposal, which would have cut NASA by 1 percent to $19.1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is NASA''s best budget since 2009, when it received a temporary $1 billion boost from the economic stimulus bill.</p><p>And it wasn''t just NASA. As <a href=''http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/science-gets-major-boost-2018-us-spending-deal''>Science Magazine points</a> out, every federal science program maintained or grew its budget. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, the Department of Energy''s Office of Science&mdash;all will receive budget increases. Basically, Congress grew the size of the pie, so nearly everyone was able to take a bigger slice.</p><p>Several Planetary Society funding priorities were contained in this bill. First and foremost, the robotic Mars Exploration Program receives a $75 million increase with specific directions to ''support the Mars Sample return mission and orbiter'', in line with our recommendations and as a consequence of our <a href=''http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/advocacy/2017/Mars-in-Retrograde---The-Planetary-Society---2017.pdf''><em>Mars in Retrograde </em>report</a> released last year.</p><p>Planetary defense has been another major area of work for our Advocacy team this year, and we were very pleased to see NEOCam&mdash;a proposed space telescope for detecting near-Earth objects&mdash;funded at $35 million. While not ideal, this amount will help maintain critical production lines for sensors needed by this mission.</p><p>And then there''s Europa, the mission The Planetary Society and its members have worked so hard to support over the years. It stands to receive $595 million in 2018, not just for the Clipper spacecraft, but for work on a lander as well. The legislation reiterates that the mission launch in 2022 on a Space Launch System rocket. NASA has stated it wants to launch the Clipper in 2025 on a commercial rocket.</p><p>The Planetary Society and its members worked hard for these goals in addition to larger budgets for NASA and science in general. Congress listened, and key members of the appropriations committees really came through for these important priorities. They also explicitly supported the priorities recommended by the scientific community through the decadal survey process&mdash;another commendable action and important to a stable future of space science and exploration.</p><p>Okay, let''s break things down.</p></div>','698.png',-27,2,16);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','700.png',20,7,48);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','705.png',51,9,68);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','715.png',32,8,56);

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','730.png',48,9,66);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','740.png',97,13,99);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','745.png',-21,3,20);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument.

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','755.png',84,12,90);

Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','760.png',70,11,81);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','770.png',6,5,38);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','780.png',-42,1,6);

We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','785.png',72,11,82);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

Congress thoroughly rejected every major cut proposed to NASA and other science agencies by the Trump Administration, often providing them with funding increases instead. This is arguably the best budget for national science investment in a decade.</p><p>Should this legislation pass, NASA would receive a $1.1 billion increase to $20.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. This is a far better outcome than the White House''s original proposal, which would have cut NASA by 1 percent to $19.1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is NASA''s best budget since 2009, when it received a temporary $1 billion boost from the economic stimulus bill.</p><p>And it wasn''t just NASA. As <a href=''http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/science-gets-major-boost-2018-us-spending-deal''>Science Magazine points</a> out, every federal science program maintained or grew its budget. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, the Department of Energy''s Office of Science&mdash;all will receive budget increases. Basically, Congress grew the size of the pie, so nearly everyone was able to take a bigger slice.</p><p>Several Planetary Society funding priorities were contained in this bill. First and foremost, the robotic Mars Exploration Program receives a $75 million increase with specific directions to ''support the Mars Sample return mission and orbiter'', in line with our recommendations and as a consequence of our <a href=''http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/advocacy/2017/Mars-in-Retrograde---The-Planetary-Society---2017.pdf''><em>Mars in Retrograde </em>report</a> released last year.</p><p>Planetary defense has been another major area of work for our Advocacy team this year, and we were very pleased to see NEOCam&mdash;a proposed space telescope for detecting near-Earth objects&mdash;funded at $35 million. While not ideal, this amount will help maintain critical production lines for sensors needed by this mission.</p><p>And then there''s Europa, the mission The Planetary Society and its members have worked so hard to support over the years. It stands to receive $595 million in 2018, not just for the Clipper spacecraft, but for work on a lander as well. The legislation reiterates that the mission launch in 2022 on a Space Launch System rocket. NASA has stated it wants to launch the Clipper in 2025 on a commercial rocket.</p><p>The Planetary Society and its members worked hard for these goals in addition to larger budgets for NASA and science in general. Congress listened, and key members of the appropriations committees really came through for these important priorities. They also explicitly supported the priorities recommended by the scientific community through the decadal survey process&mdash;another commendable action and important to a stable future of space science and exploration.</p><p>Okay, let''s break things down.</p></div>','793.png',-7,4,30);

I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','795.png',-4,5,32);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','800.png',-28,2,15);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','810.png',23,7,50);

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','825.png',54,10,70);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','835.png',9,6,40);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','840.png',15,6,44);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument.

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','850.png',50,9,68);

Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','855.png',-46,1,3);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','865.png',-39,1,8);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','875.png',99,13,100);

We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','880.png',52,9,69);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

Congress thoroughly rejected every major cut proposed to NASA and other science agencies by the Trump Administration, often providing them with funding increases instead. This is arguably the best budget for national science investment in a decade.</p><p>Should this legislation pass, NASA would receive a $1.1 billion increase to $20.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. This is a far better outcome than the White House''s original proposal, which would have cut NASA by 1 percent to $19.1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is NASA''s best budget since 2009, when it received a temporary $1 billion boost from the economic stimulus bill.</p><p>And it wasn''t just NASA. As <a href=''http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/science-gets-major-boost-2018-us-spending-deal''>Science Magazine points</a> out, every federal science program maintained or grew its budget. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, the Department of Energy''s Office of Science&mdash;all will receive budget increases. Basically, Congress grew the size of the pie, so nearly everyone was able to take a bigger slice.</p><p>Several Planetary Society funding priorities were contained in this bill. First and foremost, the robotic Mars Exploration Program receives a $75 million increase with specific directions to ''support the Mars Sample return mission and orbiter'', in line with our recommendations and as a consequence of our <a href=''http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/advocacy/2017/Mars-in-Retrograde---The-Planetary-Society---2017.pdf''><em>Mars in Retrograde </em>report</a> released last year.</p><p>Planetary defense has been another major area of work for our Advocacy team this year, and we were very pleased to see NEOCam&mdash;a proposed space telescope for detecting near-Earth objects&mdash;funded at $35 million. While not ideal, this amount will help maintain critical production lines for sensors needed by this mission.</p><p>And then there''s Europa, the mission The Planetary Society and its members have worked so hard to support over the years. It stands to receive $595 million in 2018, not just for the Clipper spacecraft, but for work on a lander as well. The legislation reiterates that the mission launch in 2022 on a Space Launch System rocket. NASA has stated it wants to launch the Clipper in 2025 on a commercial rocket.</p><p>The Planetary Society and its members worked hard for these goals in addition to larger budgets for NASA and science in general. Congress listened, and key members of the appropriations committees really came through for these important priorities. They also explicitly supported the priorities recommended by the scientific community through the decadal survey process&mdash;another commendable action and important to a stable future of space science and exploration.</p><p>Okay, let''s break things down.</p></div>','888.png',11,6,41);

I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','890.png',50,9,67);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','895.png',-26,3,17);

On the left, the enhanced surface image has been colorized using data from methane filters in a way that mimics the natural color of Titan.</div></div><p>There was a full session devoted to Cassini on Monday (<a href=''https://www.sciencenews.org/article/5-things-about-saturn-cassini-mission''>Lisa Grossman wrote up a nice summary here</a>), but then on Tuesday, another morning session focused entirely on Titan, called &ldquo;<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/sess203.pdf''>Titan Is Terrific</a>&rdquo;. (That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','905.png',53,10,70);

Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion.

The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','920.png',85,12,91);

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','930.png',3,5,36);

When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','935.png',84,12,90);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology?

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','945.png',53,9,69);

Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','950.png',-37,2,10);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','960.png',-6,4,30);

His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','970.png',-9,4,28);

We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','975.png',94,13,97);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

Congress thoroughly rejected every major cut proposed to NASA and other science agencies by the Trump Administration, often providing them with funding increases instead. This is arguably the best budget for national science investment in a decade.</p><p>Should this legislation pass, NASA would receive a $1.1 billion increase to $20.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. This is a far better outcome than the White House''s original proposal, which would have cut NASA by 1 percent to $19.1 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this is NASA''s best budget since 2009, when it received a temporary $1 billion boost from the economic stimulus bill.</p><p>And it wasn''t just NASA. As <a href=''http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/science-gets-major-boost-2018-us-spending-deal''>Science Magazine points</a> out, every federal science program maintained or grew its budget. The National Science Foundation, NOAA, the Department of Energy''s Office of Science&mdash;all will receive budget increases. Basically, Congress grew the size of the pie, so nearly everyone was able to take a bigger slice.</p><p>Several Planetary Society funding priorities were contained in this bill. First and foremost, the robotic Mars Exploration Program receives a $75 million increase with specific directions to ''support the Mars Sample return mission and orbiter'', in line with our recommendations and as a consequence of our <a href=''http://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/pdfs/advocacy/2017/Mars-in-Retrograde---The-Planetary-Society---2017.pdf''><em>Mars in Retrograde </em>report</a> released last year.</p><p>Planetary defense has been another major area of work for our Advocacy team this year, and we were very pleased to see NEOCam&mdash;a proposed space telescope for detecting near-Earth objects&mdash;funded at $35 million. While not ideal, this amount will help maintain critical production lines for sensors needed by this mission.</p><p>And then there''s Europa, the mission The Planetary Society and its members have worked so hard to support over the years. It stands to receive $595 million in 2018, not just for the Clipper spacecraft, but for work on a lander as well. The legislation reiterates that the mission launch in 2022 on a Space Launch System rocket. NASA has stated it wants to launch the Clipper in 2025 on a commercial rocket.</p><p>The Planetary Society and its members worked hard for these goals in addition to larger budgets for NASA and science in general. Congress listened, and key members of the appropriations committees really came through for these important priorities. They also explicitly supported the priorities recommended by the scientific community through the decadal survey process&mdash;another commendable action and important to a stable future of space science and exploration.</p><p>Okay, let''s break things down.</p></div>','983.png',-18,3,22);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','985.png',88,12,93);

Arguably the best tool for eavesdropping in real time—by detecting the weak magnetic fields emitted by communicating neurons—comes with a huge caveat: Participants must keep their heads absolutely still inside an enormous scanner. That makes the method, magnetoencephalography (MEG), a no-go for young children, and it nixes studying brain behavior while people are moving. Now, scientists have developed the first device to solve those problems, a masklike instrument that can transmit brain signals even when the wearer is moving.</p><p>Despite some limits on how much of the brain’s activity can be mapped at once, neuroscientists are excited. “This is remarkable,” says MEG researcher Matti Hamalainen of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study. “MEG is moving forward conceptually into a new era.”</p><p>When neurons interact with one another, their weak electrical current generates a tiny magnetic field. To measure it with conventional MEG, scientists have people stick their heads inside a scanner like an “old-style hair dryer at a salon,” explains physicist Richard Bowtell of the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. Inside the scanner are superconductors, loops of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors that need to be kept extremely cold by liquid helium.</p><p>It’s an incredibly powerful technology, Bowtell says, but a person moving just 5 millimeters will ruin any attempt to read their brain activity. To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href=''https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147''>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage. The cost of doing that, nearly $1 million, would be prohibitively expensive for many researchers, Bowtell says, though he expects the price to drop as the technology matures.</p><p>But Timothy Roberts, a neuroradiologist who works with children with autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, says MEG masks like this one would be worth it. Neuroscientists could one day use them to track early brain development or to record brain signals in adults with movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Or, says Roberts, to finally get a good look at the brain activity of his often fidgety patients. “Asking a child with autism to sit still is not very easy. Asking a toddler to sit still is impossible. … I think this work is transformative.”</p><span content=''This wearable brain scanner could transform our understanding of how neurons ‘talk’'' class=''rdf-meta element-hidden''></span></div>','990.png',-1,5,34);

(That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface. [<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2717.pdf''>Abstract #2717</a>]</p><p>If you like Titan petrology, how about Titan seismology? Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)

The center image shows Titan approximately as it would appear to the human eye, its surface hidden by haze and its north pole experiencing a summer ''hood''. On the right, surface details are revealed by looking at Titan in an infrared wavelength (''CB3'') at which methane is relatively transparent, and correcting for the affect of the methane in the atmosphere by dividing that image by one taken in a wavelength where methane absorbs light. On the left, the enhanced surface image has been colorized using data from methane filters in a way that mimics the natural color of Titan.</div></div><p>There was a full session devoted to Cassini on Monday (<a href=''https://www.sciencenews.org/article/5-things-about-saturn-cassini-mission''>Lisa Grossman wrote up a nice summary here</a>), but then on Tuesday, another morning session focused entirely on Titan, called &ldquo;<a href=''https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/sess203.pdf''>Titan Is Terrific</a>&rdquo;. (That link will take you to a PDF program for the session, with links to two-page abstracts on all the talks.) Project scientist Linda Spilker told me that the organizing committee received so many Titan submissions that the mission asked the meeting to create a second session devoted to the complex moon. I found three of the talks to be particularly thought-provoking.</p><p>It kicked off with Chris Glein talking about how a nasty gas &ndash; hydrogen cyanide (HCN) &ndash; behaves in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere, and what that might mean for the search for the fossil record of the beginnings of life on Earth. &ldquo;Something strange and wonderful is happening with nitrogen fractionation in HCN,&rdquo; he said. His standards for &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; might be different from yours, but what he was talking about is that at Titan, the heavier isotope of nitrogen, nitrogen-15, is far more abundant in HCN than it is in the much more common nitrogen-carrying atmospheric gas, regular old molecular nitrogen (N2). The reasons I won&rsquo;t go into because I don&rsquo;t want to get sidetracked. Glein&rsquo;s point is that the same process could very well have happened on the very earliest Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. And HCN is an incredibly important precursor molecule to sticking nitrogen into prebiotic compounds like amino acids. So any incredibly early life would likely have been drawing this highly fractionated nitrogen from HCN in the atmosphere. The organic materials from 4-billion-year-old organisms, if they existed, has long ago been turned into graphite or other inorganic-looking materials in rocks. But we could go looking at the nitrogen in those rocks and see what the isotopic ratios are. If there&rsquo;s an excess of nitrogen-15, it could&rsquo;ve come from HCN in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, processed by early life into proteins.

The areas around them are often light-colored. One hypothesis for the light areas around the dark lakes is that they are made of solids that evaporated out of the lake liquid (or formed some other way, like frost or solidified ''sea spray'').</div></div><p>Then Morgan Cable gave a talk about &ldquo;Molecular Minerals on Titan.&rdquo; Titan is a place where the atmosphere creates large quantities of small organic molecules like ethane, acetylene, propane, and so on. These fall out onto the surface with methane and ethane rain, and some of them accumulate in lakes. Around the edges of lakes scientists have observed &ldquo;bathtub rings&rdquo;, bright-colored haloes around the lakes. We don&rsquo;t know for sure but it&rsquo;s possible that these are made of materials deposited as lakes evaporate, leaving behind evaporite deposits, like salts form around evaporating lakes on Earth. The materials that form evaporites will be the least soluble materials. In a Titan lake, Cable said, the first thing you&rsquo;d expect to fall out of solution would be benzene. But it wouldn&rsquo;t just be benzene; when benzene forms crystals, it readily incorporates ethane into its crystal structure, forming a &ldquo;co-crystal&rdquo;. If it&rsquo;s a crystal and it forms solid deposits, what you&rsquo;ve got is a mineral &ndash; and the beginning of the science of Titan petrology. Cable said they looked around for other small molecules and found that acetylene readily forms lots of different co-crystals, notably with ammonia. They formed their co-crystals in the lab and tried wetting them (raining on it) with a mix of methane and ethane, and the solids stayed &ndash; suggesting they&rsquo;d persist as solid deposits on Titan. One unusual thing about these minerals is that when they warm, they experience a lot of thermal expansion. So if you formed this material on Titan&rsquo;s surface, and then buried it (either by subduction or just by covering it with other stuff), it could expand as it warmed with depth, causing stresses that might produce physical evidence on the surface.

Mark Panning&rsquo;s talk was about that, motivated by the <a href=''http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/''>Dragonfly mission concept</a> and its plans for a seismic instrument. Seismic data (recordings of ground motion caused by earthquake waves) can tell scientists about the internal structure of a world regardless of what it&rsquo;s made of. Titan would have regular icequakes caused by the flexing of its crust due to tides with every Saturn orbit. When kids are taught about seismology, they learn about P and S and surface waves, and Titan would have all of those. But because it has an ice shell over a liquid ocean, there would also be some other interesting kinds of lower-frequency waves moving through the ice shell. For example, there&rsquo;s a flexural wave, in which the whole ice shell bends back and forth slowly. There are Crary waves, which are waves trapped within the ice shell whose frequency is sensitive to the thickness of the ice shell. Panning used Apollo seismic data for the Moon (which also has quakes caused mostly by tidal forces) to make some predictions about how common quakes of different sizes would be on Titan. Then he asked questions like: how sensitive does the seismic instrument need to be to detect several quakes over the course of the mission? (The answer: medium-sensitive compared to off-the-shelf Earth seismometers.) How bad is atmospheric noise? (The answer: wind will be pretty noisy, but the bigger events should still be detectable.) Would waves on lakes cause noise? (The answer: they can, but if the instrument is close to the equator, it won&rsquo;t be an issue.) And: is there any spot on Titan that&rsquo;s more likely than anywhere else to have large quakes? (The answer: they&rsquo;re expected to be fairly uniformly distributed, except that the sub-Saturn and anti-Saturn points have less quakes than everywhere else, so aiming near the leading or trailing points would be best for seismic studies.)
