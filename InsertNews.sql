To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.

To study the brain during motion-related tasks, MEG researchers have devised ingenious ways to simulate movement in virtual reality.</p><p>To work around such workarounds, Bowtell’s team created a wearable 3D-printed mask that, instead of using superconductors as sensors, relies on 13 small glass cubes filled with vaporized rubidium. These optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) get to work when a laser pulses through the vapor, lining up the atoms in its path. When neural current from the brain generates a small magnetic field, it knocks the atoms out of formation. A sensor on the other side measures fluctuations in the light from the laser to paint a map of brain activity.</p><p>Elena Boto, a physicist at the University of Nottingham, was the first to try the mask out. To compare it to a conventional scanner, she performed a series of tasks—including bending and pointing her finger, drinking from a cup, and bouncing a ball on a paddle—while using both devices. Even though her head bobbed to and fro in the mask, the brain activity recorded <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature26147'>was practically identical to that of the fixed scanner</a>, the researchers report today in <cite>Nature</cite>.</p><p>Some challenges remain. To counteract interference from Earth’s magnetic field, researchers had to set up two large panels with magnetic coils on either side of the mask, limiting Boto’s range of motion. Expanding the range of motion to allow for something like walking is a technically difficult chore.</p><p>But the biggest hurdle is cost. The OPM sensors, designed and manufactured by QuSpin of Louisville, Colorado, are expensive, each costing about $7000. The 13 sensors in the current mask could target only one region of the brain at a time—many dozens more would be needed to give scientists full-brain coverage.
